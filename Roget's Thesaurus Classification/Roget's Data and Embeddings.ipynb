The notebook is divided into distinct sections, each focusing on a step of the process from data acquisition to preprocessing and finally, embedding generation. <br>\n",

Both are transformer model that are dedicaded to better understand phrases and sentences. These two are selected in order to see the difference between the quality of the embeddings that they produce. Although the results might be better if instead of words, as input for the models, we used small sentences that descreabe the meaning of the word.  "
