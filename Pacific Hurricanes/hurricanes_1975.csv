0,Hurricane Agatha,"An area of disturbed weather about 290mi (467km) southwest of Acapulco formed on June 1. It organized into a tropical depression the next day. After heading southwestward, it turned to the northwest and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2. Agatha maintained its course and steadily intensified. It reached hurricane intensity on June 3 while located about 170mi (270km) southwest of Zihuatanejo. Hurricane Agatha started weakening thereafter, becoming a tropical storm on June 4 and a depression on June 5. It dissipated shortly afterwards. At this time, Agatha was located about 140mi (230km) south of the Tres Marias Islands. Even though Agatha passed close to Mexico as it weakened, no impact is known to have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek freighter en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.",June 1,June 7,0,"Southwest of Acapulco, near Zihuatanejo, south of the Tres Marias Islands, near San Clemente Island"
1,Tropical Storm Bridget,"On June 27, a tropical depression formed about 575mi (925km) south of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula at a location atypical for tropical cyclogenesis. The depression moved generally westward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Bridget on June 28. It started accelerating as it turned towards the northwest, then west, and eventually to the southwest. Bridget weakened into a tropical depression on July 2 and dissipated the next day. It remnant circulation hung about in the area for a few more days. Bridget never came near land and thus, no deaths or damage were recorded.",June 27,July 3,0,None
2,Hurricane Carlotta,"A disturbance 480mi (772km) south of Acapulco organized into a tropical depression on July 2. It headed generally west-northwest and steadily intensified, becoming a tropical storm later on July 2. It became a hurricane on July 3 and ultimately peaked as a Category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Carlotta was first major hurricane, Category 3 or higher, of the season. It began weakening thereafter, and was a tropical storm by July 8. Carlotta became a depression on July 10 and dissipated the next day. The hurricane did not come near land and caused no significant impact.",July 2,July 11,0,None
3,Hurricane Denise,"An unstable area developed a circulation and became a tropical depression on July 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical storm on July 7. The next day, it was a hurricane and turned to the west. Continuing to strengthen, it reached Category4 intensity on July 9. This windspeed was the highest of the season. The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical storm on July 13. It weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter. Denise brought winds of near-gale force to parts of Mexico, but otherwise caused no damage or casualties.",July 4,July 14,0,parts of Mexico
4,Tropical Storm Eleanor,"An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on July 10, 100mi (160km) south of Acapulco. As its center of circulation became more pronounced and it was upgraded into Tropical Storm Eleanor. The tropical storm moved northwestward, and later curved northward. The system made landfall near Manzanillo on July 12. It quickly dissipated. Eleanor brought 20mph (32km/h) winds the Manzanillo, but damage from the storm is minor due to the lack of heavy rains.",July 10,July 12,0,Manzanillo
5,Tropical Storm Francene,"A rapidly moving squally area of disturbed weather that was moving on a northwestward path was upgraded into Tropical Depression Seven on July 27. It intensified into a tropical storm later that day. Francene turned to the west and weakened into a tropical depression on July 28. It slowly weakened and ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone on July 30. Francene's remnants persisted as a tropical disturbance for another twelve hours, before completely dissipating. This tropical cyclone caused no known impact.",July 27,July 30,0,None
6,Tropical Storm Georgette,"An area of disturbed weather about 800mi (1,287km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas organized a tropical depression on August 11. It was upgraded to tropical storm intensity the next day. After heading generally westward and peaking as a weak to moderate tropical storm on August 12, Georgette slowly weakened. It weakened into a depression on August 14 and underwent extratropical transition thereafter. The cyclone dissipated twelve hours later. Tropical Storm Georgette had no impact on land.",August 11,August 14,0,None
7,Tropical Storm Hilary,"A tropical disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system was classified as Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned a little bit more westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.",August 11,August 17,0,None
8,Hurricane Ilsa,"On August 18, a tropical depression formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec from a tropical wave that had entered the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. The tropical storm moved westward, and became a hurricane on August 21. Ilsa became a Category 2 hurricane on August 22. It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved out to sea. On August 25, Ilsa turned westward and rapidly weakened. It fell to tropical storm intensity on August 26. Later that day, while still maintaining winds of gale-force, Ilsa ceased being a tropical cyclone. Ilsa's remnants continued out over the open Pacific Ocean. The remains of Ilsa eventually interacted with another weather system. That triggered the development of the unnamed hurricane of August 31–September 5 Hurricane Ilsa caused no casualties or damage. As the unnamed hurricane formed from Ilsa's remnants, Ilsa and the latter system are unofficially the same tropical cyclone. Indeed, this year's seasonal report from the Redwood City Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center, in the Monthly Weather Review includes a brief discussion of the unnamed hurricane in the report's section on Hurricane Ilsa. Neither the Central Pacific Hurricane Center nor the official HURDAT ""best track"" database of tropical cyclone location and intensity data explicitly considers them the same. Hence, as far as official records matter, Ilsa and the unnamed hurricane of August 31 – September 5 are different tropical cyclones.",August 18,September 5,0,None
9,Hurricane Jewel,"On August24, a tropical depression formed from a tropical disturbance about 250mi (400km) south of Acapulco. It intensified into Tropical Storm Jewel the next day. The tropical cyclone headed generally northwest and paralleled the coast of Mexico. On August27, Jewel became a hurricane for mere six hours, the minimum possible time in HURDAT. Jewel then turned to the west, and then back to the northwest. Jewel weakened to depression strength on August31. Tropical Depression Jewel dissipated shortly after that, although its remnants remained distinct until September3. There was no impact.",August 24,September 3,0,None
10,Hurricane Katrina,"On August29, an area of weather developed directly into a tropical storm, skipping the tropical depression stage. Katrina steadily intensified as it headed west-northwest, gradually turning to the northwest. It peaked in intensity on September3 as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (209km/h), the second highest of the season. Katrina then headed westward and rapidly weakened. It was downgraded into a tropical storm on September5 and a depression on September6. The last advisory was issued on September7 when Katrina dissipated. Although the hurricane brought Category3-equivalent winds to Socorro Island on September2, no damage was reported there or anywhere else.",August 29,September 7,0,Socorro Island
11,Unnamed hurricane,"The remnants of Hurricane Ilsa interacted with a mid-level trough to produce a new low-level circulation on August31, about 930 miles (1,500km) northeast of Hawaii. The new system absorbed the remnants of Ilsa as it moved westward. Thunderstorms increased around the low, resembling a subtropical cyclone by September1. Its track over warmer waters caused the storm to transition into a tropical storm on September2, by which time the convection organized into rainbands. By that time, the storm was about 685 miles (1,102km) north of the Hawaiian island of Kauai. The storm quickly developed a central dense overcast, and by 00:00UTC on September 3 Dvorak classifications began on the cyclone. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the north and northeast. Around that time, the storm developed an eye in the center of the convection, suggesting that it intensified into a hurricane late on September3, located about 1,170 miles (1,885km) south of Alaska. It was a small system, measuring about 85 miles (140km) in diameter. A nearby ship reported sustained winds of 63mph (102km/h), while another nearby ship reported a pressure of 1003mbar (29.6inHg), with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5mbar (0.40inHg), suggesting a minimum pressure of under 990mbar (29inHg). After maintaining hurricane status for about 18hours, the storm weakened due to strong wind shear from the approaching cold front. Early on September 5, the cyclone became extratropical in the Gulf of Alaska, while located about 315 miles (510km) southwest of Juneau, Alaska. On the same day, the circulation was rapidly absorbed by the frontal system, and the remnants quickly reached the coast of British Columbia. The remnants of the storm turned southeastward, and the low was last tracked definitively to a point north of Montana.",August 31,September 5,0,"Hawaii, Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia, Montana"
12,Hurricane Lily,"Rain and wind reports from the Acapulco weather station suggested that a tropical depression was developing. This was confirmed on September16 from ship reports. It intensified into a tropical storm and was named Lily. Tropical Storm Lily headed northwest in a nearly straight path. By 0000 UTC September18, the system was a moderate tropical storm located about 160mi (260km) south of Manzanillo Lily was upgraded to hurricane status on the same day and eventually reached its peak strength. After passing southwest of Socorro Island, Lily weakened, becoming a storm on September20. Lily weakened into a depression on September21, turned to the west-southwest, and dissipated. Its remnants remained visible until September24, when they were no longer distinct via weather satellite. On September19, the cyclone brought hurricane-force winds to Socorro Island. No damage or casualties were reported.",September 16,September 24,0,"Socorro Island, Manzanillo"
13,Tropical Storm Monica,"In late September, three tropical disturbances moved westward across the eastern Pacific Ocean. One of them organized into a tropical depression on September28. The next day the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica then gradually weakened. It became a tropical depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. No impact was reported in association with Tropical Storm Monica.",September 28,October 1,0,None
14,Tropical Storm Nanette,"On September28, a system developed into a tropical depression, simultaneously with Tropical Storm Monica.. It headed generally westward and on September29, 18 hours after Monica did it, strengthened into a tropical storm. Nanette continued out to sea and slowly strengthened. It peaked in windspeed of 50mph (85km/h) on October3 and turned to the southwest. It then slowly weakened. On October4, it weakened into a tropical depression and then degenerated into a disturbance that same day. No damage or deaths were reported.",September 28,October 4,0,None
15,Hurricane Olivia,"On October22, Tropical Depression Eighteen formed from a cluster of three thunderstorms south of Mexico and then strengthened into a tropical storm. It moved northwestward initially, followed by a northeast turn. Olivia then intensified steadily. It reached Category 3 intensity and a peak of 115mph (185km/h) winds just before landfall. Early on October25, Olivia moved ashore just south of Mazatlán causing major damage. Olivia destroyed 7,000houses in the region, leaving 30,000people homeless, and damage totaled $20million (1975USD, $113million 2024USD). The hurricane killed 30people, 20 of them were from drownings in shrimp boats.",October 22,October 25,30,south of Mazatlán
16,Tropical Storm Priscilla,"A nearly stationary cloudy area developed a circulation on November2. The depression drifted north for a while before turning to the west-northwest on November3. It intensified into a tropical storm on November4. Priscilla then began turning to the north. However, the system failed to re-curve, instead, the tropical storm turned generally westward. The tropical storm peaked in windspeed as a 65mph (100km/h) high-end storm on November5. It then turned to the northwest on a heading nearly directly at Clarion Island, but it dissipated on November7 about 115mi (185km) short of landfall.",November 2,November 7,0,Clarion Island
